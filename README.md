## INTRODUCTION

The data visualization for my final project is about for ages 20 - 49, the incidence of different types of cancer in the U.S. in 2013. I found the data from [National Cancer Institute](https://seer.cancer.gov/faststats/selections.php#Output). 

Users can find out the incidence of a specific type of cancer and know which type has the highest rate of incidence. By hovering the bar chart, they can see the data.
